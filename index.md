## **Project Group:**

* Umesh Chounde

* Jitesh Golatkar

## **Project Motivation**
<p align="justify">
Today there are billions of people carrying smart devices such as smartphones, fitness gadgets, smartwatches. These sensor-rich gadgets generate larger amount of data that can be utilized using machine learning techniques and big data techniques for mining and deriving meaningful insights about human activity. Some of the common applications that are widely used are fitness trackers, and personal assistant systems for disabled people. Having personally used such devices for tracking the activities,  we felt that it would be interesting to know how they classify activities and thus we decided to implement the classification algorithm we studied in this course.</p>

## **Dataset Information**
<p align="justify">
In this project we are the WISDM dataset released by WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) Lab in the Department of Computer and
Information Science of Fordham University. WISDM dataset consists of raw accelerometer data collected from smartphones and smartwatches. This data is collected from 51 individuals who were assigned to execute 18 different tasks for 3 minutes. Each individual was had smartwatch and smartphone placed on them. There are total 15630426 instances consisting of 6 attributes (subject_id, activity, timestamp, x-reading, y-reading, z-reading). This is a labelled dataset, thus is suitable for classification tasks. 
We have only used accelerometer data for this project. The activities we explored are: Walking, Jogging, Stairs, Sitting, Standing. We stripped the readings for other activities.
We use following label mappings for the activities during classification:
</p>

|  Walking   |  Jogging   |  Stairs   |  Sitting   |  Standing  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.0 | 4.0 | 5.0 |

Dataset: 
[WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WISDM+Smartphone+and+Smartwatch+Activity+and+Biometrics+Dataset+)

The accelerometer form devices measures the acceleration in 3 dimensions, along with x axis, y axis and z axis.

* X axis acceleration describes horizontal movement body. 
* Y axis acceleration describes upward and downward movement of body. 
* Z axis acceleration describes forward movement of body.

## **Feature Selection and Data Preparation:**
<p align="justify">
We studied the oringinal research paper and small set of data for each activity such as walking and jogging. We came to know that acceleration of x, y, z axis plays an important role in differentiating the activities. We also considered peak values of accelerations that can help us differentiate activity, because jogging will be having most peak acceleration compared to walking and other activities. In the case of climbing up and down of stairs have periodic actions and we can detect those activities based on activity periodicity. In case of normal activity such as sitting we get constant acceleration for long period.  After thorough study and research we came up with following features might be helpful for building a model. The given data is already sorted according to activity and timestamp of each user.</p>
    
### Average acceleration:
<p align="justify">
Each activity data records are divided in batches of 200 records. We calculated average acceleration for each axis of the record.</p>
   
### Variance:
<p align="justify">
Each activity data records are divided in batches of 200 records. We calculated variance of acceleration for each axis of the record.</p>
   
### Average absolute difference:
<p align="justify">
We calculated average acceleration for each axis and took absolute difference with average acceleration. Average of this absolute difference is calculated again.</p>
   
### Average resultant acceleration:
<p align="justify">
Average resultant is calculated using the formula. (1/n * sum [√(x² + y² + z²)]) </p>
   
### Average time between peaks 
<p align="justify">
Initially we calculated global maxima for each axis acceleration. Selected all the other local maximum who has value more than 90% of global maxima. Then average of all such values are taken.</p>


## **Algorithms**

### Naive Bayes Classification 
*   Implementation of Naive Bayes using Spark from scratch.
*   Since the data attributes are continuous values, we have to use Gaussian Naive Bayes to calculate probabilities.
*   From pre-processed input LabeledPoints, we extract the RDDs for individual features.
*   For each individual feature, we sum readings of each label using reduceByKey and take the mean and collect final result as a Map of means for each label.
*   For each individual feature and for each label, we take squared sum of difference between each reading and mean for that label, using reduceByKey and take the mean and collect final result as a Map of variance of each label.
*   Save the mean and variance for each feature of a label into a text file as a trained model.
*   Formula:
